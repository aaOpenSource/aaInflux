# How to contribute

We are really excited you have taken an interest in our little project.  Our goal is to to eventually have so many contributors it becomes difficult to tell who exactly started or "owns" the project.

The best way to contribute, as with many other similarly new projects, is to just take a look around and identify one of many areas that could use improving.  Don't bother asking for permission, just fork it and go!

## Areas to contribute

With such a young project we've got opportunities everywhere.  The best place to start is the [Issues](/../../issues) List

##Non-Wonderware Contributions
Right now it is impossible to test if you don't have a Wonderware System Platform Galaxy deployed.  However, if you like you might like to help with some work around the store/forward mechanism.  Once we refactor to split out the concerns a little better it should be easier.

## Testing

Currently we have no tests.  Wanna jump in and help?

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](/../../pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request we will love you forever if you include test coverage. Please follow our loose coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

Thanks,

Andy Robinson, Phase 2 Automation
